<body>  <h1>Fundamental Principles in Civil Engineering</h1>
  <p>This webpage introduces the basic but most important principles in Civil Engineering. These ideas guide everything we build — from small houses to massive bridges and dams. We’ll focus on two areas: Applied Mathematics and Hydraulics & Fluid Mechanics.</p>  <div class="section">
    <h2>2.1 Applied Mathematics</h2>
    <p>Applied Mathematics is using math to solve real-world engineering problems. In civil engineering, we use it to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Design buildings and roads</li>
      <li>Calculate forces, materials, and loads</li>
      <li>Work with measurements and geometry</li>
    </ul><h3>Basic Formulas:</h3>
<p><strong>1. Area of Shapes</strong></p>
<code>Rectangle = length × width</code>
<code>Triangle = 0.5 × base × height</code>
<code>Circle = π × radius²</code>

<p><strong>2. Volume</strong></p>
<code>Cube = side³</code>
<code>Rectangular Box = length × width × height</code>
<code>Cylinder = π × radius² × height</code>

<p><strong>3. Trigonometry (for sloped surfaces or triangle problems)</strong></p>
<code>sin(θ) = opposite / hypotenuse</code>
<code>cos(θ) = adjacent / hypotenuse</code>
<code>tan(θ) = opposite / adjacent</code>

<p><strong>4. Force (Newton's Second Law)</strong></p>
<code>F = m × a</code> (Force = mass × acceleration)

<h3>Example:</h3>
<p>You want to calculate the area of a triangular concrete slab. The base is 3 meters, and the height is 2 meters.</p>
<code>Area = 0.5 × 3 × 2 = 3 m²</code>

<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Even simple math errors can cause major structural failures, so every number counts!</p>

  </div>  <div class="section">
    <h2>2.2 Hydraulics and Fluid Mechanics</h2>
    <p>This is the study of water and other fluids. Civil engineers use this knowledge to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Design drainage and water supply systems</li>
      <li>Prevent flooding</li>
      <li>Build dams, canals, and pipelines</li>
    </ul><h3>Basic Concepts:</h3>
<p><strong>1. Pressure</strong></p>
<code>Pressure (P) = Force / Area</code>
<p>Used when calculating how much force water applies on a surface (like a dam wall).</p>

<p><strong>2. Flow Rate</strong></p>
<code>Q = A × V</code> (Flow Rate = Area × Velocity)
<p>Q is how much water flows through a pipe every second.</p>

<p><strong>3. Bernoulli’s Equation</strong> (For moving fluids)</p>
<code>P + 0.5ρv² + ρgh = constant</code>
<p>This means energy is conserved. As speed increases, pressure drops (like water from a hose).</p>

<p><strong>4. Continuity Equation</strong></p>
<code>A1 × V1 = A2 × V2</code>
<p>Water flowing in must flow out — used for pipe design.</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<p>Water flows through a pipe that is 0.2 m² in area at a speed of 3 m/s. What is the flow rate?</p>
<code>Q = A × V = 0.2 × 3 = 0.6 m³/s</code>

<h3>Real Use:</h3>
<p>When designing a drainage system, we need to know how much rainwater will flow off roads so we can make pipes big enough.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Applied Math:</strong> The language of engineering. It helps us calculate and measure accurately.</li>
      <li><strong>Hydraulics & Fluids:</strong> Helps control water safely and design systems that manage flow and pressure.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These two areas are just the beginning of what civil engineers need to master. But once you get them, everything else becomes easier.</p>

</html>    <h2>What are Fundamental Principles?</h2>
    <p>These are the core ideas used to solve problems, design structures, and work with nature. They include mathematics, physics, and natural forces like gravity and fluids.</p>
  </div>  <div class="section">
    <h2>2.1 Applied Mathematics</h2>
    <p>Applied Mathematics is used in civil engineering to solve real-world problems.</p><h3>Key Topics and Formulas:</h3>

<p><strong>1. Algebra:</strong></p>
<div class="formula">ax + b = 0  &rarr;  x = -b/a</div>

<p><strong>2. Geometry:</strong></p>
<div class="formula">Area of Triangle = (1/2) * base * height</div>
<div class="formula">Area of Circle = π * r²</div>

<p><strong>3. Trigonometry:</strong></p>
<div class="formula">sin(θ) = opposite / hypotenuse</div>
<div class="formula">cos(θ) = adjacent / hypotenuse</div>
<div class="formula">tan(θ) = opposite / adjacent</div>

<p><strong>4. Calculus:</strong></p>
<div class="formula">dy/dx = rate of change</div>
<div class="formula">∫f(x)dx = area under curve</div>

<p><strong>5. Statistics:</strong></p>
<div class="formula">Mean = (Σx) / n</div>
<div class="formula">Standard Deviation = √(Σ(x - mean)² / n)</div>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<div class="example">
  Calculate the area of a triangle with base = 10m and height = 5m.<br>
  Area = (1/2) * 10 * 5 = 25 m²
</div>

  </div>  <div class="section">
    <h2>2.2 Hydraulics and Fluid Mechanics</h2>
    <p>This field studies how water and fluids behave when still or moving. It's key in designing pipes, canals, and flood control systems.</p><h3>Key Principles and Formulas:</h3>

<p><strong>1. Pressure:</strong></p>
<div class="formula">P = F / A</div>
<p>Where: P = Pressure, F = Force, A = Area</p>

<p><strong>2. Hydrostatic Pressure:</strong></p>
<div class="formula">P = ρ * g * h</div>
<p>Where: ρ = density of fluid, g = gravity, h = height</p>

<p><strong>3. Flow Rate (Q):</strong></p>
<div class="formula">Q = A * v</div>
<p>Where: Q = flow rate, A = area, v = velocity</p>

<p><strong>4. Bernoulli’s Equation:</strong></p>
<div class="formula">P + 1/2 * ρ * v² + ρ * g * h = constant</div>

<p><strong>5. Continuity Equation:</strong></p>
<div class="formula">A1 * v1 = A2 * v2</div>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<div class="example">
  If water flows through a pipe with area 0.5 m² at a speed of 3 m/s,<br>
  Q = A * v = 0.5 * 3 = 1.5 m³/s
</div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
