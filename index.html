  <h1>Fundamental Principles in Civil Engineering</h1>
  <p>In civil engineering, we have to understand some basic ideas that guide all the work we do. These are called fundamental principles. They help us plan, design, and build things like buildings, roads, and bridges safely and correctly.</p>  <h2>2.1 Applied Mathematics</h2>
  <p>Applied math means using math to solve real problems. In civil engineering, we use math every day to measure, calculate, and design structures. Here's what it includes:</p>  <h3>Algebra</h3>
  <p>We use algebra to solve unknowns in equations. For example, calculating load or force.</p>
  <div class="formula">F = ma</div>
  <p><strong>F</strong> is force, <strong>m</strong> is mass, <strong>a</strong> is acceleration.</p>
  <div class="example">
    <strong>Example:</strong> If mass = 10 kg and acceleration = 5 m/s²,<br>
    F = 10 × 5 = <strong>50 N</strong>
  </div>  <h3>Geometry</h3>
  <p>Used to calculate areas and volumes. Helpful when working on construction sites or drawing plans.</p>
  <div class="formula">Area of triangle = 1/2 × base × height</div>
  <div class="example">
    <strong>Example:</strong> Base = 6 m, Height = 4 m<br>
    Area = 1/2 × 6 × 4 = <strong>12 m²</strong>
  </div>  <h3>Trigonometry</h3>
  <p>Helps in measuring angles and slopes, especially for roads or roofs.</p>
  <div class="formula">sin(θ) = opposite / hypotenuse</div>
  <div class="example">
    <strong>Example:</strong> If opposite = 3 m and hypotenuse = 5 m<br>
    sin(θ) = 3 / 5 = <strong>0.6</strong>
  </div>  <h3>Statistics</h3>
  <p>Used to understand data like rainfall, traffic, or material strength.</p>
  <div class="formula">Mean = (sum of all values) / (number of values)</div>
  <div class="example">
    <strong>Example:</strong> Values = 3, 5, 7<br>
    Mean = (3+5+7)/3 = <strong>5</strong>
  </div>  <h2>2.2 Hydraulics and Fluid Mechanics</h2>
  <p>This part of civil engineering studies how water and other fluids move and behave. It's very important for things like designing water systems, drainage, and flood control.</p>  <h3>Hydrostatic Pressure</h3>
  <div class="formula">P = ρgh</div>
  <p><strong>P</strong> is pressure, <strong>ρ</strong> is water density (usually 1000 kg/m³), <strong>g</strong> is gravity (9.8 m/s²), <strong>h</strong> is depth.</p>
  <div class="example">
    <strong>Example:</strong> At 5 meters deep:<br>
    P = 1000 × 9.8 × 5 = <strong>49,000 Pa</strong> or 49 kPa
  </div>  <h3>Bernoulli's Equation</h3>
  <div class="formula">P + 1/2ρv² + ρgh = constant</div>
  <p>It explains how pressure, speed, and height affect fluid energy.</p>  <h3>Continuity Equation</h3>
  <div class="formula">A₁V₁ = A₂V₂</div>
  <p>This means what flows in must flow out, if no leaks.</p>
  <div class="example">
    <strong>Example:</strong> If pipe 1 has area 2 m² and speed 3 m/s, and pipe 2 has area 1 m²:<br>
    A₂V₂ = A₁V₁ → 1 × V₂ = 2 × 3 → V₂ = <strong>6 m/s</strong>
  </div>  <h3>Manning’s Equation (for open channels like canals)</h3>
  <div class="formula">V = (1/n) R<sup>2/3</sup> S<sup>1/2</sup></div>
  <p><strong>V</strong> is flow speed, <strong>n</strong> is Manning’s number (depends on surface), <strong>R</strong> is hydraulic radius, <strong>S</strong> is slope.</p>  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Applied Math and Fluid Mechanics are very important in Civil Engineering. They help us solve problems and build things properly. Even if the math seems hard at first, it helps make sure our work is safe, strong, and useful for people.</p></body>
